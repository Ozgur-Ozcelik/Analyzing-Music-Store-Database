# Music-Store-Database
Digital Music Store Database SQL Queries

In this project I have queried Chinook Music Store Database with basic to advanced SQL functions and visualized my findings by using Microsoft Excel charts.
The main goal of this project is for me to demonstrate my ability to:

• Use a combination of SQL functions (joins, subqueries, common table expressions, aggregate functions, date and text manipulations and data cleaning).

• Create visualizations of SQL queries using Microsoft Excel.
